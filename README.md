Run_Analysis.R R-script on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

The run_analysis.R script reads the Test and Training data and produces a new - tidy - dataset and writes this tidy dataset in the file "MyTidyData.txt".

A brief description of the script:

The run_analysis.R script merges data from the  .txt files and produces a tidy data set which may be used for further analysis.

First it loads the "reshape2" package.

It then reads all required .txt files and labels the datasets

A description of the "MyTidyData.txt" file may be found in the "CodeBook.md" file.
